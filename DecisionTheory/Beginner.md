### Existence of Utility Theorem
Complete the following statements by rreplacing $\text\[...\]$ with the correct symbols..
Existence of Utility Theorem: There exists a function U such that when $A\prec B$, $U(\text\[...\])>U(\text\[...\])$. And when $A\sim B$, $U(A) \text{\[...\]}  U(B)$.

### Bike Ride
You are preparing to go for a bike ride and are trying to decide whether to use your thin road tyres or your thicker, knobbier tyres. You know from previous experience that your road tyres are more likely to go flat during a ride. Thereâ€™s a 40% chance your road tyres will go flat but only a 10% chance that the thicker tyres will go flat. Because of the risk of a flat, you also have to decide whether or not to bring your tools along on the ride (a pump, tyre levers and a puncture kit). These tools will weigh you down.
The advantage of the thin road tyres is that you can ride much faster. The table below gives the utilities for these variables:

Bring tools| Flat tyre |	Road tyres |	Satisfaction|
-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
T	         |T	         |T	           |50            |
T	         |T	         |F	           |40            |
T	         |F	         |T	           |75            |
T	         |F	         |F	           |65            |
F	         |T	         |T	           |0             |
F	         |T	         |F	           |0             |
F	         |F          |T	           |100           |
F	         |F	         |F	           |75            |

- What is the optimal policy?
- What is the expected utility?

### Pacman

After years of battles between the ghosts and Pacman, the ghosts challenge Pacman to a winner-take-all showdown, and the game is a coin flip. Pacman has a decision to make: whether to accept the challenge (accept) or decline (decline). If the coin comes out heads ($+h$) Pacman wins. If the coin comes out tails ($-h$), the ghosts win. No matter what decision Pacman makes, the outcome of the coin is revealed.

Compute EU(accept) and EU(decline). From this, select the optimal decision.
