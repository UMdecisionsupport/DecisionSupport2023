## Medium Probability Exercises

### High School
The breakdown of the student body in a local high school according to race and ethnicity is 51% white, 27% black, 11% Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 5% for all others. A student is randomly selected from this high school. (To select “randomly” means that every student has the same chance of being selected.)
Find the probabilities of the following events:
- B: the student is black 
- M: the student is from an ethnic minority (non-white)

### Independence
It is known that 80% of people wear seat belts, and 5% of people quit smoking last year. If 4% of the people who wear seat belts quit smoking, are the events 'wearing a seat belt' and 'quitting smoking' independent?

### Rafting
The probability that Jamie will visit his aunt in Baltimore this year is 0.3, and the probability that he will go river rafting on the Colorado river is 0.5.
If the two events are independent, what is the probability that Jamie will do both?

### College
At a college, 20% of the students take Finite Math, 30% take History, and 5% take both Finite Math and History. If a student is chosen at random, find the following conditional probabilities.
- They are taking Finite Math given that they are taking History.
- They are taking History assuming that they are taking Finite Math.

### Counters
There are two bags. The first bag contains 4 blue counters and 3 red counters. The second contains 5 blue counters and 2 red counters. You select one counter from each bag. 
- What is the probability of having 2 red counters?
- What is the probability of having exactly 1 red counter?

### Engineers
At a college: 54% of students are female. 25% of students are majoring in engineering. 15% of female students are majoring in engineering.
Event E = student is majoring in engineering. Event F = student is female.

- Are events E and F independent? 
- Find $P(E\wedge F)$.

### Emails
It is estimated that 50% of emails are spam emails. Some software has been applied to filter these spam emails before they reach your inbox. A certain brand of software claims that it can detect 99% of spam emails, and the probability for a false positive (a non-spam email detected as spam) is 5%.
Now if an email is detected as spam, then what is the probability that it is in fact a non-spam email?

### Fruit Machine
Deciding to put probability theory to good use, we encounter a slot machine with three independent wheels, each producing one of the four symbols BAR, BELL, LEMON, or CHERRY with equal probability.
The slot machine has the following payout scheme for a bet of 1 coin (where “?” denotes that we don’t care what comes up for that wheel):
The wheel order is relevant.
• BAR/BAR/BAR pays 20 coins
• BELL/BELL/BELL pays 15 coins
• LEMON/LEMON/LEMON pays 5 coins
• CHERRY/CHERRY/CHERRY pays 3 coins
• CHERRY/CHERRY/? pays 2 coins
• CHERRY/?/? pays 1 coin

Questions:
- What is the probability of earning the biggest payout? 
- Compute the expected "payback" percentage of the machine. In other words, for each coin played, what is the expected coin return?
- Compute the probability that playing the slot machine once will result in a win (any payout).

### Senators
This table shows the distribution of Democratic and Republican U.S. Senators by gender in the 114th Congress as of January 2015.

|               | Male (M)    | Female (F) |	Total |
| :---          |:--:         |:--:        |:--:    |
|Democrats (D)  |	  30	      |   14	     |   44   |
|Republicans (R)|	  48	      |    6	     |   54   |
|Other (T)	    |    2	      |    0	     |    2   |
|Total	        |   80	      |   20	     |  100   |

Use the table to calculate the following probabilities:
- P(M|D): 
- P(D|M): 
- P(F|R): 
- P(R|F):
