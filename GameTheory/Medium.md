## Medium Game Theory Exercises

### Business Deals
Consider the game below, played by two firms $i = 1, 2$, each of them simultaneously and independently selecting to adopt either technology A or B. Technology A is regarded as superior by both firms, yielding a payoff of 2 to
each firm if they both adopt it, while the adoption of technology B by both firms only entails a payoff of 1. Importantly, if firms do not adopt the same technology, both obtain a payoff of zero. This can be explained because, even if firm $i$ adopts technology A, such a technology is worthless if firm $i$ cannot exchange files, new products and practices with the other firm. 

Find the Nash Equilibria and Pareto Optima for this game.

|     | A   | B   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| A	  | 2,2 | 0,0 |
| B   | 0,0 | 1,1 |

### Duopoly
Two countries produce oil and each can choose between producing 2 millions barrels/day or 4 millions barrels/day. The total output will be then 4, 6, or 8 millions barrels/day and the corresponding price will be $20, $12, $7 per barrel (a decreasing price reflects basic law of supply and demand).

Find the Nash Equilibria and Pareto Optima for this game.

|     | 2M  | 4M  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 2M  |40,40|24,48|
| 4M  |48,24|28,28|

### Joint Activities
Each player, Alice (A) and Bob (B) has a preferred location (football or cinema) but the more important consideration for both is that they show up at the same location.

|        |Football| Cinema |
|--------|--------|--------|
|Football| 3,2    | 1,1    |
| Cinema | 0,0    | 2,3    |


Now construct a variant with the following characteristics:
- Bob’s payoffs from the different outcomes remains as before.
- Alice still prefers football to the cinema but the more important consideration for her now is that she avoids Bob.

Reuse the payoffs 0, 1, 2 and 3 but put them in the cells appropriate for the new situation:

|        |Football| Cinema |
|--------|--------|--------|
|Football|        |        |
| Cinema |        |        |

Does this new game have a Nash equilibrium?

### Prisoner's Dilemma

|        |Testify | Refuse |
|--------|--------|--------|
|Testify |  x,x   |  -6,0  |
|Refuse  |  0,-6  |  -1,-1 |

Which value(s) of x will result in the top left being a Pareto optimum in this Prisoners’ Dilemma game?
	- x ≥ -6
	- -6 ≤ x < -1
	- -1 ≤ x < 0
	- x ≥ -1
	- x ≥ 0

Which value(s) of x will result in the top left being a Nash equilibrium?
- -6 ≤ x < -1
- x ≥ -1
- x ≥ -6
- x ≥ 0
- -1 ≤ x < 0
