### The Logician

Imagine that a logician puts four cards on the table in front of you. Each card has a number on one side and a letter on the other. On the uppermost faces, you can see E, K, 4, and 7. He claims that if a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other. Which cards do you have to turn over to check this? 


### Logic Notation
Assign the following terms to the correct symbol.

**Terms:** *conjunction, implication, disjunction, entails, derives, clauses, equivalence, literal, negation*

**Symbols:** ∨, ∧, B, ⊨, ¬, ((A∧B) ∨ (B∧¬C)), ⇒, ⇔ or ≡, ⊢


### Short Questions I

Determine the number of rows in the full truth table of a proposition containing five variables.

### Short Questions II

Are these logical statements equivalent?
- b ⇒ ¬a AND ¬a ∨ ¬b
- (a ∨ b) ∧ ¬c AND (a ∧ ¬c) ∨ (b ∧ ¬c)
- ¬(a ∨ b) AND ¬a ∨ ¬b
- a ∨ b AND b ∨ a

### Truth Tables I

Use the truth tables method to determine whether p ∧ ¬q → p ∧ q is *entailed* by ¬p.

### Trauth Tables II

Compute the truth table of (F ∨ G) ∧ ¬(F ∧ G).
