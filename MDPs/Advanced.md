### Flying Pacman

Pacman is in a 1-dimensional grid with squares labeled 0 through to n, inclusive, as shown below:

Pacmanâ€™s goal is to reach square n as cheaply as possible. From state n, there are no more actions or rewards available.

At any given state, if Pacman is not in n, Pacman has two actions to choose from:
- Run: Pacman deterministically advances to the next state (i.e. from state i to state i + 1). This action costs Pacman \$1.
- Fly: With probability p, Pacman directly reaches state n. With probability 1 - p, Pacman is stuck in the same state. This action costs Pacman \$2

For each of the scenarios below, does Value Iteration converge?

The discount factor is 1 and:

| s | a | s' | P(s,a,s')| R(s,a)|
|---|---|----|----------|-------|
| i |Run| i+1|    1     |   5   | 
| i |Fly| i+1|    1     |   5   | 


The discount factor is 1 and:

| s | a | s' | P(s,a,s')| R(s,a)|
|---|---|----|----------|-------|
| i |Run| i+1|    1     |   5   | 
| i |Fly| i-1|    1     |   5   | 


The discount factor is <1 and:
