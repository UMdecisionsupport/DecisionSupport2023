Considering the above Bayesian Network, what is the joint probability distribution associated with the Bayesian Network? 

Express the answer as a product of terms representing individual conditional probabilities tables associated with this Bayesian Network. Make it as concsie as possible.

Match the joint distributions to the networks.
- $P(A) P(B) P(C|A,B) P(D) P(E|B,C,D)$
- $P(A) P(B|C) P(C|A) P(D|A) P(E|C)$
- $P(A) P(B|C) P(C|A) P(D|C,E) P(E|C)$
- $P(A) P(B) P(C|A,B) P(D|C) P(E|C)$
