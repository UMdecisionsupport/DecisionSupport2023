- What is the optimal policy?
- What is the expected utility?



### Pacman Network

The ghost chooses a number $G$ and Pacman randomly chooses a number $P$ at the same time. A computer generates a number $X~U(0,10)$ and then another number $Y~U(0,X)$. The utility is $f(G,P,X,Y)$ for a fixed function $f$. Select the decision network(s) that can correctly represent the problem for the ghost.
