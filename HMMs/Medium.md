Mr. X is happy some days and angry on other days. We can only observe when he smiles, frowns, laughs, or yells but not his actual emotional state. Let us start on day 1 in the happy state. There can be only one state transition per day. It can be either to happy state or angry state. The HMM is shown above.

Assume that $q_t$ is the state on day $t$ and $o_t$ is the observation on day $t$.
