## Solutions to the Beginner Exercises

### Restuarant Menu
Each of the 3 starters could be paired with any of the 3 mains. This gives 9 different combinations.

### Marbles
- There are 9 elements in the sample space; $S = \{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}$.
- There are 6 elements in the event space; $E = \{(1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}$.
- So the probability of the event is $P(E)=\frac{6}{9}=\frac{2}{3}$.
- There is no change to the probability if sampling is done without replacement.

### Letters
- There are 11 letters and of those 4 are vowels. So the probability of randomly selecting a vowel is 4/11.
- For 4 letters, there are 4·3·2·1 = 24 possible orders. However, the words will be the same regardless of the arrangement of the two Ls. So, there are 12 distinct words.

### Socks
The probability of the first being white is $\frac{5}{9}$. The probability of the second being white, given the first is white, is $\frac{4}{8}$. So the overall probability is the product of these two; $\frac{5}{18}\approx 0.278$.

### Independence
If A and B are independent, and $P(B|A)=0.4$, what is $P(B)$?


### Cards
A card is drawn from a standard 52 card deck. Use $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\wedge B)}{P(B)}$ to calculated the following:
- $P(Queen|Face)$
- $P(Queen|Club)$

*Give the answer as a simple fraction. A face card could be a King, Queen or Jack.*

### Independent Cards
- If the card is a queen, then the probability that it is a king is 0. This has changed compared to when the whole pack is considered. 
- When only considering face cards, kings make up $\frac{1}{3}$ of the cards. This has clearly changed compared to the whole pack.
- In the whole pack, face cards make up $\frac{12}{52}=\frac{3}{13}$. This is the same proportion as they make up if only the 26 red cards are considered.
- In the whole pack, kings make up $\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}$. This is the same proportion as they make up if only the 26 red cards are considered.

### Spinners
- The probabilities should sum to 1. So p = 1-0.5-0.2-0.12 = 0.18.
- The probability of a 2 is 0.2. So, across 50 spins would expect 50x0.2 = 10 spins to give a 2.
- This would require both spinners to fall on 1. So the probability is 0.5x0.5 = 0.25 (as they are independent).
