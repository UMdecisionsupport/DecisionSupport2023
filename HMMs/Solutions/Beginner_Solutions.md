## Solutions to the Beginner Exercises

### Monkey Chocolate Factory
Imagine that you work at a chocolate factory. Your job is to keep an eye on the conveyor belt, watching the chocolates as they come out of the press one at a time.
You make two types of chocolates: ones with almonds and ones without. Assume you can tell with 100% accuracy what the chocolate contains from looking at it. In the control room, there is a lever that switches the almond control on and off. When the conveyor is turned on at the beginning of the day, there is a 50% chance that the almond lever is on, and a 50% chance that it is off. As soon as the conveyor belt is turned on, it starts making a piece of candy.
Unfortunately, someone has let a monkey loose in the control room, and it has locked the door and started the conveyor belt. Between each chocolate being made, there is a 30% chance that the monkey switches the lever to the other position (i.e. turns almonds on if it was off, or off if it was on). 

1. Write down the prior distribution and the transition matrix.
2. Are the following statements True or False?
   - This is a Markov Model.
   - This is a Hidden Markov Model.
   - This would become a Markov Model if the chocolate type was unknown.
   - This would become a Hidden Markov Model if the chocolate type was unknown.
