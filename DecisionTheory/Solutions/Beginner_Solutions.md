## Solutions to the Beginner Exercises


### Existence of Utility Theorem
Complete the following statements by replacing $\text\[...\]$ with the correct symbols..
Existence of Utility Theorem: There exists a function U such that when $A\prec B$, $U(A)>U(B)$. And when $A\sim B$, $U(A) =  U(B)$.

### True or False
- The agent’s preferences are captured by a reward function. **False**
- The value of perfect information is always non-negative. **True**
- Decision nodes are represented as rectangles. **True**
- To calculate the Value of Perfect Information, it is necessary to know the previous expected utility. **True**

### Bike Ride
There are four possible policies; a choice must be made between the two types of tyre and whether or not to take tools.

- Road tyres and tools: EU = 0.4 · 50 + 0.6 · 75 = 65
- Road tyres and no tools: EU = 0.4 · 0 + 0.6 · 100 = 60
- Other tyres and tools: EU = 0.1 · 40 + 0.9 · 65 = 62.5
- Other tyres and no tools: EU = 0.1 · 0 + 0.9 · 75 = 67.5
So the optimal choice is the other tyres and no tools with an EU of 67.5.

### Pacman
$EU(accept)=P(+h)U(+h,accept)+P(-h)U(-h,accept)=0.5\cdot100+0.5\cdot-100=0 $

$EU(decline)=P(+h)U(+h,decline)+P(-h)U(-h,decline)=0.5\cdot-30+0.5\cdot50=10 $

So the optimal decision is to decline the offer.

### Robot Mailman
- When an accident does **NOT** happen, A is true.

- What shape should each of the nodes be?
  - Accident: oval
  - Route: rectangle
  - Pads: rectangle
  - Utility: diamond

- Which arrows (if any) should definitely be included between the following pairs?
  - Accident and Route: right to left
  - Accident and	Pads: none
  - Accident	and Utility: left to right
  - Route	and Pads: none
  - Route and	Utility: left to right
  - Pads and Utility: left to right
