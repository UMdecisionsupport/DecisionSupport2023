## Solutions to the Advanced Exercises


### Help the Farmer

#### Inference
The first two work, the second is impractical for calculations but not incorrect. 

#### Sampling I

- Yes
- 0.41

#### Sampling II
- 0.05
- $-o +w -s +h +e$

### Sampling I
### Part A
- $+a, -b, +c, -d $: rejected
- $+a, -b, +c, +d $: not rejected
- $-a, +b, -c, -d $: rejected
- $+a, +b, +c, +d$: not rejected

#### Part B
Rejection sampling: 3 of the 5 have +a, hence, 3/5.

Likelihood weighting: $\frac{0.4+0.4+0.2}{0.4+0.4+0.2+0.2+0.2}=\frac{5}{7}$. This values come from the likelihood of getting each of the samples.
