## Solutions to the Advanced Exercises

### Course Selection
Assume that Ron and Hermione select analysis with probabilities $r$ and $h$ respectively. This gives probabilities of $1 − r$ and $1 − h$ of selecting economics.

For Ron, the expected payoff is as follows:
• EP (Analysis) = $4h + 1(1 − h) = 3h + 1$
• EP (Economics) = $0h + 3(1 − h) = 3 − 3h$


For Hermione the expected payoff is as follows:
• EP (Analysis) = $3r + 0(1 − h) = 3r$
• EP (Economics) = $1r + 4(1 − r) = 4 − 3r$

Solving $3h + 1 = 3 − 3h$ and $3r = 4 − 3r$ gives $h = 1/3$ and $r = 2/3$. So Hermione should select analysis with a probability of $1/3$ and economics with a probability of $2/3$. Ron should do the opposite.


### Matching Pennies
|     | T   | H   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| T   | 1,-1| -1,1|
| H   | -1,1| 1,-1|

Let $x$ and $y$ be the probabilities of players 1 and 2 selecting H respectively. Then EP $(p2 = H) = x − (1 − x) = 2x − 1$ and EP $(p2 = T ) = −x + (1 − x) = 1 − 2x$. Setting these equal to each other and solving gives $x = 1/2$.


### Free Time II
In the first game Alice, chooses football with probability $\frac{3}{4}$ and Bob chooses the cinema with probability $\frac{1}{4}$. The total chance of a meeting either at the football stadium or in front of the cinema is $2 \times (\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{1}{4}) = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375$. However, the most likely outcome is that Alice goes to a match and Bob to the cinema (probability 0.5625).

In the second game, the one where Alice seeks to avoid Bob, Alice chooses football with probability $\frac{3}{4}$, as before, but Bob now picks football also with probability $\frac{3}{4}$. Now, the most likely outcome is that they meet at the match (probability 0.5625). Their chance of meeting at the cinema is 0.0625. Thus, the total chance of meeting is 0.625, much higher than in the first game.
