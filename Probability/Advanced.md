## Advanced Probability Exercises

### Probability Game
In a game, it is only possible to score 10, 20 or 30 points. The probability of scoring 20 points is twice the probability of scoring 30 points. The probability of scoring 20 points is half the probability of scoring 10 points.
What is the expected points scored from one round of the game?

### Tennis Match
The probability that a tennis player wins the first set of a match is \frac{3}{5}. If she wins the first set, the probability that she wins the second set is $\frac{9}{10}$. If she loses the first set, the probability that she wins the second set is $\frac{1}{2}$.
Given that the tennis player wins the second set, find the probability that she won the first set.

### Measles
A doctor is called to see a sick child. The doctor has prior information that 90% of sick children in that neighborhood have the flu, while the other 10% are sick with measles. Let $F$ stand for an event of a child being sick with flu and $M$ stand for an event of a child being sick with measles.
Assume for simplicity that $F\cup M=\Omega$, i.e., that there no other maladies in that neighborhood.
A well-known symptom of measles is a rash (the event of having which we denote $R$). Assume that the probability of having a rash if one has measles is $P(R|M)=0.95$. However, occasionally children with flu also develop rash, and the probability of having a rash if one has flu is $P(R|F)=0.08$. Upon examining the child, the doctor finds a rash.
What is the probability that the child has measles?

### Mice
Whether certain mice are black or brown depends on a pair of genes, each of which is either $B$ or $b$. If both members of the pair are alike, the mouse is said to be homozygous, and if they are different it is said to be heterozygous. The mouse is brown only if it is homozygous $bb$.
The offspring of a pair of mice have two such genes, one from each parent, and if the parent is heterozygous, the inherited gene is equally likely to be $B$ or $b$.
- Suppose that a black mouse results from a mating between two heterozygotes. What are the probabilities that this mouse is homozygous and that it is heterozygous?
  - Homozygous: 
  - Heterozygous: 

- Now suppose that this mouse is mated with a brown mouse, resulting in seven offspring, all of which turn out to be black. Use Bayesâ€™ Theorem to find the probability that the black mouse was homozygous $BB$.

### Game Day
Josie wants to know whether her team will win the next match. She noticed that her team wins more often, when it is wearing their home jerseys (j) and when it is sunny (s). Next weekend, the wheather is supposed to be sunny and they are playing in their home jerseys. Josie wants to know $P(w|j,s)$. Because Josie also likes statistics, she already gathered the following information:
- $P(J,S)$
- $P(W)$
- $P(J|W)$
- $P(S|W)$

Does this suffice to compute $P(w|j,s)$?
