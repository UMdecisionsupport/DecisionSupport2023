## Solutions to the Beginner Exercises


### Snowdrift I
I will give to Robert and Chelsea each a gift worth $40 if I receive $30 in cash. Their options are to either pay the fee or to not pay the fee knowing that if both of them decide to pay, then they will share the fee and pay $15 each.

Complete the payoff table for the game.

|       | Pay   |Not Pay|
|-------|-------|-------|
|Pay	  | 25,25 | 10,40 |
|Not Pay| 40,10 |  0,0  |


### Ultimatum I
Consider the following experiment where $100 are handed to Robert and he is given the task to split the amount of money between himself and Chelsea any
way he wants. Then Chelsea has the option to accept the deal and take the money offered, or to refuse in which case both go empty-handed. Here, Robert has two options: offer a fair split, say 60-40, or offer a unequal split, 85-15. Chelsea also has two options, accepting any offer or accepting only the fair offer.

Write down the payoff matrix for the game.

|            |Accept Any|Accept Fair|
|-------     |-------   |-------    |
|Fair Split	 | 60,40  	|  60,40    |
|Unfair Split| 85,15    |   0,0     |


### Nash Equilibrium & Pareto-Optimal Outcome I

### Nash Equilibrium & Pareto-Optimal Outcome II
