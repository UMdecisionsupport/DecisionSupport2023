## Medium Game Theory Exercises

### Business Deals
Consider the game below, played by two firms $i = 1, 2$, each of them simultaneously and independently selecting to adopt either technology A or B. Technology A is regarded as superior by both firms, yielding a payoff of 2 to
each firm if they both adopt it, while the adoption of technology B by both firms only entails a payoff of 1. Importantly, if firms do not adopt the same technology, both obtain a payoff of zero. This can be explained because, even if firm i adopts technology A, such a technology is worthless if firm i cannot exchange files, new products and practices with the other firm. 
Find the set of Nash Equilibria (NE) in this game.
