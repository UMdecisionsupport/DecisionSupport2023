## Advanced Game Theory Exercises

### Course Selection
Ron and Hermione are choosing courses for their next semester. Ron is interested in Analysis whilst Hermione is interested in Economics. However, they prefer to take the same course so that they are together.
Their respective payoffs are shown below:

|     | A   | E   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| A   | 4,3 | 1,1 |
| E   | 0,0 | 3,4 |

Find a mixed strategy equilibrium.

### Matching Pennies
Consider the game in which each player can choose HEADS (H) or TAILS (T); if the two players match, Player 1 wins; if the two players differ, Player 2 wins. What strategy should each player play?

Determine the payoff matrix. Then find a mixed strategy equilibrium.	

### Free Time II
Look at these two games. Each player, Alice (A) and Bob (B) has a preferred location (football or cinema) but the more important consideration for both is that they show up at the same location (Game 1) or that Alice can avoid Bob (Game 2).

Game 1:

|        |Football| Cinema |
|--------|--------|--------|
|Football| 3,2    | 1,1    |
| Cinema | 0,0    | 2,3    |

Game 2:

|        |Football| Cinema |
|--------|--------|--------|
|Football| 1,2    | 3,1    |
| Cinema | 2,0    | 0,3    |

What is the most likely outcome in each game? When is it more likely that Alice and Bob meet â€“ when Alice wants to meet Bob or when she wants to avoid him?
