## Beginner Probability Exercises

### Restuarant Menu
A restaurant offers a set menu with a choice of three starters - soup (S), prawn cocktail (P) or bruschetta (B), and three main courses - lamb (L), hake (H) or chicken (C).

How many different possible events are there?

### Marbles
A jar contains three marbles numbered 1, 2, and 3. Consider if two marbles are drawn with replacement, and we want the sum of the numbers to be at least 4.
*You should distinguish between a marble being drawn first or second.*
- How many elements are in the sample space S? 
- How many elements are in the event space E? 
- What is the probability of the sum of the numbers being at least 4? 
- How does the probability of the sum of the numbers being at least 4 change if the marbles are sampled without replacement? 


### Letters
Answer the following questions:
- What is the probability of randomly selecting a vowel from PROBABILITY?
- Given the letters in the word TALL, how many different words can be produced by rearranging the letters? *(They do not need to be real words.)*

### Socks
A sock drawer contains 5 white socks and 4 black socks. A sock is taken at random and put on. Another sock is taken and put on.
What is the probability of the socks both being white?

### Independence
If A and B are independent, and $P(B|A)=0.4$, what is $P(B)$?


### Cards
A card is drawn from a standard 52 card deck. Use $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\wedge B)}{P(B)}$ to calculated the following:
- $P(Queen|Face)$
- $P(Queen|Club)$

*Give the answer as a simple fraction. A face card could be a King, Queen or Jack.*

### Independent Cards
Which of the following pairs of events are independent, when considering drawing cards from a pack?
- The card is a king and the card is a queen.
- The card is a king and the card is a face card.
- The card is a face card and the card is red.
- The card is a king and the card is red.

### Spinners
A spinner has four sections numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.
The probabilities of the spinner landing on a number are listed below:

| Number on Spinner| 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
| :---             |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Probability      |0.5 |0.2 |0.12| ?  |

- What is the probability of the spinner landing on a 4? 
- If the spinner was spun 50 times, how many times would you expect it to show the number 2? 
- Let there be two of these same spinners, and the numbers they give are summed. What is the probability of the sum being 2?
