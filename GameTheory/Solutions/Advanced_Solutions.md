## Solutions to the Advanced Exercises

### Course Selection
Ron and Hermione are choosing courses for their next semester. Ron is interested in Analysis whilst Hermione is interested in Economics. However, they prefer to take the same course so that they are together.
Their respective payoffs are shown below:

|     | A   | E   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| A   | 4,3 | 1,1 |
| E   | 0,0 | 3,4 |

Find a mixed strategy equilibrium.

### Matching Pennies
Consider the game in which each player can choose HEADS (H) or TAILS (T); if the two players match, Player 1 wins; if the two players differ, Player 2 wins. What strategy should each player play?

Determine the payoff matrix. Then find a mixed strategy equilibrium.	

### Free Time II
In the first game Alice, chooses football with probability $\frac{3}{4}$ and Bob chooses the cinema with probability $\frac{1}{4}$. The total chance of a meeting either at the football stadium or in front of the cinema is $2 \times (\frac{3}{4}) \times (\frac{1}{4}) = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375$. However, the most likely outcome is that Alice goes to a match and Bob to the cinema (probability 0.5625).

In the second game, the one where Alice seeks to avoid Bob, Alice chooses football with probability $\frac{3}{4}$, as before, but Bob now picks football also with probability $\frac{3}{4}$. Now, the most likely outcome is that they meet at the match (probability 0.5625). Their chance of meeting at the cinema is 0.0625. Thus, the total chance of meeting is 0.625, much higher than in the first game.
