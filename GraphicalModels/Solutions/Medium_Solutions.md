Chris is a farmer. He has a hen in his barn, and it will lay at most one egg per day. Chris collects data and discovers conditions that influence his hen to lay eggs on a certain day, as described in the image.

Instead of the Bayesian Network shown, Chris would like a diagnostic network. Which node should he start from?

### Markov Blanket I

- C,D
- A,B,E

### Markov Blanket II
