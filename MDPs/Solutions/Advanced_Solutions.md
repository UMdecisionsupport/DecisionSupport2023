## Solutions to the Advanced Exercises

### Flying Pacman
The first converges, as there are only a finite number of moves that can be made. The second doesn't converge, as Pacman could get infinite rewards by moving between i and i+1 indefinitely. The third converges since the change in discount factor continuously reduces the value of continuing the loop seen in the second example.
