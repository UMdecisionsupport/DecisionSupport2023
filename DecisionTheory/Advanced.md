Andy’s got a problem: he has a crush on Brianna and doesn’t know if he should ask her out. One day, Andy watches lecture and realizes something — he can model his current worry as a decision net! He drew up the following network with utility function $U(A,B)$:

- $A \in {yes, no}$: Whether Andy asks Brianna out
- B: How Brianna feels towards Andy
- F: How Brianna’s best friend thinks of Andy
- M: Brianna’s mood when Andy is around her
- R: The time it takes for Brianna to reply to Andy’s messages
- C: The courseload that Brianna is taking this semester
VPI is the value of perfect information. These questions are designed for you to think about how this is affected by the relationship between variables.
Indicate whether the following are always, sometimes or never true:

- VPI(R|M)>0 
- VPI(C)<=0 
- VPI(F,B)>VPI(B) 
- VPI(R,M|B)=VPI(R|B)+VPI(M|B) 

### College Indecision
Max is paying to enter a lottery for summer classes, and his favorite class, CS 188, is among the $n$ possible classes. CS 188 would cost $10, and all other classes in the lottery cost $1. Max is a rational agent, and his utility function is $U(\$x) = x^2$, where $x$ is the cost of the class that Pacman wins in the lottery.
Pacman would win 1 of $n$ possible classes in the lottery. What is the utility of the lottery?
