## Solutions to the Advanced Exercises


### Pure Romance
- $VPI(R|M)>0$: Sometimes. It is possible that knowing R after knowing M will provide additional useful information.
- $VPI(C)<=0$: Always. When R is unknown, C is independent of B. So knowing more information about C is worthless.
- $VPI(F,B)>VPI(B)$: Never. They will always be equal since knowing F once you already know B adds nothing.
- $VPI(R,M|B)=VPI(R|B)+VPI(M|B)$:	Always.

### College Indecision

$\frac{1}{n}\cdot U(\$10)+(1-\frac{1}{n})\cdot U(\$1)$=$\frac{1}{n}\cdot100+(1- \frac{1}{n})\cdot1 =\frac{1}{n}\cdot99 + 1$
